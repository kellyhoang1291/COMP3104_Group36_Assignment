Learning devops is important because if you look at the SDLC you will see that 
most of the steps in the process arent actually coding. They are:

- Planning
- Defining
- Designing
- Building
- Testing
- Deployment

Out of all these steps most coding is done in the building phases, while the stages after building
consist of other supporting tasks in which devops plays a major role in. Devops purpose to reduce
repetitive tasks and automate them, building is time consuming and programmers arent
usually interested in wasting time waiting for something to build. Testing is critical
in ensuring that a code base is working well and relatively bug free. Deployment can be a major
pain, especially when it begins to grow and you have to manage multiple deployments access regions of
the world.

These domains on thier own would require loads of staff to deal with without devops and 
the tools created to facilicate the automation of said tasks. That is why it's important
to learn devops, because it might have a steep learning curve but it really will make your life
as a dev easier if you stick with it.
