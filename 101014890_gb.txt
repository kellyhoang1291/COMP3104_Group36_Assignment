georgebrown is a college location in toronto ontario. It was founded in 1967,
and according to wikipedia it has 32,117 students, which is only 7000 less people than 
live in the province of Nunavut. Another fun fact is that the blue that george brown
uses is the same one that the Royal bank of Canada uses. 

The St. James Campus also remains closed after a fire last year, this has forced students 
to remain hybrid, taking some courses purely online and others on the other campus.
It's quite interesting how a fire could cause enough damaage to keep the enite campus closed
down, rather then the area of the fire which happened on the sixth floor. 

Also appearently the st james campus was discovered to have asbestos containing material (ACM)
in some areas of the dry wall which is obviously a little bit concerning and it makes
one wonder if any of the other campus's dry walls also have ACM.
